    A file to organize all of the global dependencies for our project, as
    well as the assets for our game, rather than pollute our main.lua file.

-- push is a library that will allow us to draw our game at a virtual
-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic
-- https://github.com/Ulydev/push
push = require 'lib/push'

-- the "Class" library allows us to represent anything in
-- the game as code, rather than keeping track of many separate variables and
-- methods
-- https://github.com/vrld/hump/blob/master/class.lua
Class = require 'lib/class'

-- a basic StateMachine class which will allow us to transition to and from
-- game states smoothly and avoid monolithic code in one file
